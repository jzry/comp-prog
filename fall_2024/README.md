# Fall 2024 Training

The goal of this repository is just to store all my competitive programming problems solved and solutions so I could refer back to them in order to improve my problem solving skills. My goal is to become a better programmer.

## Data structures and algorithms

I will include detailed descriptions of common data structures and algorithms required to solve a variety of computer science and math problems.

## Reviews

I will do a review of several approaches that I can take in solving a problem and what solution I ultimately pick, and my reasoning behind it. I will include drawings and diagrams so I could refer back to it.
